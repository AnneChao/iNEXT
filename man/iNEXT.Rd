\title{iNterpolation and EXTrapolation of Hill number}
\usage{
iNEXT(x, q = 0, datatype = "abundance", rowsum = TRUE, size = NULL,
  endpoint = NULL, knots = 40, se = TRUE, nboot = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix, data.frame (species by sites), or list of species abundances or incidence frequencies. If \code{datatype = "incidence"}, then the first entry of the input data must be total number of sampling units in each column or list.}

\item{q}{a numeric value specifying the diversity order of Hill number .}

\item{datatype}{data type of input data: individual-based abundance data (\code{datatype = "abundance"}) or
sampling-unit-based incidence data (\code{datatype = "incidence"}).}

\item{rowsum}{a logical variable to check if the input object is raw data (species by sites matrix, \code{rowsum=FALSE}) or iNEXT default input (abundance counts or incidence frequencies, \code{rowsum=TRUE}).}

\item{size}{an integer vector of sample sizes (number of individuals or sampling units) for which diversity estimates will be computed.
If NULL, then diversity estimates will be computed for those sample sizes determined by the specified/default \code{endpoint} and \code{knots} .}

\item{endpoint}{an integer specifying the sample size that is the \code{endpoint} for rarefaction/extrapolation.
If NULL, then \code{endpoint} \code{=} double reference sample size.}

\item{knots}{an integer specifying the number of equally-spaced \code{knots} (say K, default is 40) between size 1 and the \code{endpoint};
each knot represents a particular sample size for which diversity estimate will be calculated.
If the \code{endpoint} is smaller than the reference sample size, then \code{iNEXT()} computes only the rarefaction esimates for approximately K evenly spaced \code{knots}.
If the \code{endpoint} is larger than the reference sample size, then \code{iNEXT()} computes rarefaction estimates for approximately K/2 evenly spaced \code{knots} between sample size 1 and the reference sample size, and computes extrapolation estimates for approximately K/2 evenly spaced \code{knots} between the reference sample size and the \code{endpoint}.}

\item{se}{a logical variable to calculate the bootstrap standard error and 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{nboot}{an integer specifying the number of replications.}
}
\value{
a list of three objects: \code{$DataInfo} for summarizing data information;
\code{$iNextEst} for showing diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples along with related statistics;
and \code{$AsyEst} for showing asymptotic diversity estimates along with related statistics.
