Description: Provides simple functions to compute and plot two types 
    (sample-size- and coverage-based) rarefaction and extrapolation curves for species
    diversity (Hill numbers) based on individual-based abundance data or sampling-unit-
    based incidence data; see Chao and others (2014, Ecological Monographs) for pertinent
    theory and methodologies, and Hsieh, Ma and Chao (2016, Methods in Ecology and Evolution)
    for an introduction of the R package.
