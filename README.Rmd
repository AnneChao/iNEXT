iNEXT (R package)

The program iNEXT (iNterpolation and EXTrapolation) is an updated R package from the original version supplied in Appendix of Chao et al. (2014). In this updated version, we have added more user-friendly features. Please notice the updated time and replace your old version by the most recent one.

The user provides a vector of abundances of individual species (abundance data) or incidences of individual species (incidence data). iNEXT computes the iNEXT computes the following species richness estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals:

1. Sample-size-based rarefaction and extrapolation: species richness estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples up to a size specified by the user (i.e., an endpoint, see below). Refer to Colwell et al. (2012) for details.
2. Coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation: species richness estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples for sample coverage up to a coverage specified by the user (i.e., an endpoint, see below). Refer to Chao and Jost (2012) for details.

iNEXT also plots the following three integrated sampling curves suggested in Chao et al. (2014) for unified sampling and estimation in species diversity analysis.

- Sample-size-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curve: this curve plots the species richness estimates for a rarefied and extrapolated sample with respect to sample size up to a specified endpoint.
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(object.iNEXT, type=1) # S3 method
ggiNEXT(object.iNEXT, type=1) # ggplot2 method
```

- Sample completeness curve: this curve plots the sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage) with respect to sample size. The curve provides a bridge between sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation.
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(object.iNEXT, type=2) # S3 method
ggiNEXT(object.iNEXT, type=2) # ggplot2 method
```

- Coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curve: this curve plots the species richness estimates for rarefied sample and extrapolated sample with respect to sample coverage up to a specified endpoint.

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(object.iNEXT, type=3) # S3 method
ggiNEXT(object.iNEXT, type=3) # ggplot2 method
```

### Software needed to run the development version

-   Required: [R](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
-   Suggested: [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/)

### How to run: start R(Studio) and copy-and-paste the following commands:

Start R(Studio) and copy-and-paste the commands below:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
## install iNEXT package from CRAN
install.packages("iNEXT")

## install the latest version from github
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('JohnsonHsieh/iNEXT')
library(iNEXT)
```


Remark that in order to install `devtools` package, you should update R
to the last version. Further, to get `install_github` to work, you
should install the `httr` package.

### Example

Copy-and-paste the commands below:
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
library(iNEXT)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
data(spider)
out <- iNEXT(spider, q=c(0, 1, 2), datatype="abundance", endpoint=500)
ggiNEXT(out, type=1, facet.var="site")
ggiNEXT(out, type=1, facet.var="order", color.var="site")

## Not run:
# display black-white theme
ggiNEXT(out, type=1, facet.var="order", grey=TRUE)

# S3 method for class 'iNEXT'
plot(out, type=1)
## End(Not run)
```
```{r ex1, echo=FALSE}
data(spider)
out <- iNEXT(spider, q=c(0, 1, 2), datatype="abundance", endpoint=500)
ggiNEXT(out, type=1, facet.var="site")
ggiNEXT(out, type=1, facet.var="order")

```


```{r eval=FALSE}
ggiNEXT(out, type=2, facet.var="none", color.var="site")
```
```{r ex2, echo=FALSE}
ggiNEXT(out, type=2, facet.var="none", color.var="site")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggiNEXT(out, type=3, facet.var="site")
ggiNEXT(out, type=3, facet.var="order", color.var="site")
```
```{r ex3, echo=FALSE}
ggiNEXT(out, type=3, facet.var="site")
ggiNEXT(out, type=3, facet.var="order", color.var="site")

```

Run a sample-based example
```{r ex4, eval=FALSE}
data(ant)
iNEXT(ant$h50m, q=c(0,1,2), datatype="incidence") 
```
